Here's something I've been working on that utilises the Mesh capabilities of the Argon, Boron, and Xenon. It uses a single device as the controller, and sends activate commands to each slave device to activate they're LEDs.  
The advantage to this is that different sets of LEDs can be wirelessly linked to be controlled from a single microcontroller.

**Note: To make full use of this project, you will need to change the Device IDs stored in the code under deviceIndex[], and the Device names stored in flash-to-all.bat to match the devices you are using.**
