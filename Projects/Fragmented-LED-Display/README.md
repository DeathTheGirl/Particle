Here's something I've been working on that utilises the Mesh capabilities of the Argon, Boron, and Xenon. It uses a device as the controller, and sends activate commands to each slave device to activate they're LEDs.  
The advantage to this is that different sets of LEDs can be wirelessly linked to be controlled from a single microcontroller.
